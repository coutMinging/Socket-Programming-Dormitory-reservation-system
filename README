I have Completed all the requirements for this assignment

servermain.c: This code creates a TCP server that listens for client requests and 
            checks which campus a department belongs to. It reads the department data from a 
            file and handles each client connection in a separate process using fork(). 
            The server sends back the campus ID or "Not found" based on the client's request.

client.c: This code is a TCP client that connects to a server, sends department names, and displays 
            the server's response.

I reused the socket programming function in main() from beej's guide to network programming
